# Improving Vieb

Feel free to report issues, or even open a pull request to solve something.
If you have any interest in contributing code,
make sure to follow these guidelines when working on it:

- Use Vim to edit :)
- Follow the included eslint style guide (using [ALE](https://github.com/w0rp/ale) or similar)
- Use editorconfig (there is a [Vim plugin available](https://github.com/editorconfig/editorconfig-vim))
- Probably more, but the above is good enough for now

# LICENSE

## Program/source

Vieb is created by [Vimproved Venture](https://github.com/VimprovedVenture) and [contributors](https://github.com/VimprovedVenture/Vieb/graphs/contributors).
See the source files for individual authors (mostly [Ian Baremans](https://github.com/ianbaremans) & [Jelmer van Arnhem](https://github.com/Jelmerro)).

You can copy or modify the code/program under the terms of the GPL3.0 or higher.
For more information and legal terms see the LICENSE file.

## Logo

Logo is created by [Jelmer van Arnhem](https://github.com/Jelmerro) and can also be copied/modified as described in the LICENSE file.
It is clearly based on the original Vim logo,
which can be found as an svg file [on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Vimlogo.svg).
As is explained on [the official Vim website](https://www.vim.org/logos.php) the logo consists of a green diamond with the text Vim displayed above it.
The Vieb logo (while based on the Vim logo) does not contain either the green diamond nor the Vim text,
and is therefor considered to be sufficiently different from the original Vim logo.

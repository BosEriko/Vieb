    <h1 id="intro">Intro</h1>
    Welcome to Vieb's official, complete and offline documentation.
    You can ALWAYS come back to this page using <kbd>F1</kbd> from ANY mode.
    The documentation consists of a single page, separated into sections.
    These sections can be accessed using the table of contents,
    or by using the help command with the section as the first argument.
    Please make sure to read the first chapter called "Basics" to get started with Vieb,
    which will explain what commands are and why there is no mouse interaction.
    Use these steps to scroll the webpage:
    <ul>
        <li>Press <kbd>Escape</kbd> once to make sure you are in normal mode.</li>
        <li>Now scroll up and down with <kbd>k</kbd> and <kbd>j</kbd>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Vieb is short for "Vim Inspired Electron Browser" and can be found on
        <a href="https://github.com/Jelmerro/Vieb">github</a>.
    </p>
    <h1 id="contents">Contents</h1>
    <div class="toc">
    </div>
    <h1 id="basics">Basics</h1>
    Interaction with Vieb is heavily focused on the keyboard,
    and is mostly inspired by the popular text editor Vim.
    If you think a key is mapped to a weird keyboard combination,
    it's probably because it's also weird in Vim.
    Clicking links, scrolling, navigating,
    and most other tasks have dedicated keyboard shortcuts.
    The most important ones will be explained in this chapter.
    Single key actions will be listed like this <kbd>f</kbd>,
    modifiers such as shift will be displayed as: <kbd>Shift with f</kbd>.
    <h2 id="basics-modes">modes</h2>
    Vieb uses different modes to separate functionality.
    By default, you should be in normal mode,
    but you can go back to normal mode at any time by pressing <kbd>Escape</kbd>.
    The mode is always prominently displayed in the navbar,
    between the Vieb logo and the url input.
    Modes can be switched to by pressing a certain key from normal mode.
    Aside from normal mode, the following modes are available:
    <ul>
        <li>
            <span class="nav">Nav</span>
            - Upon pressing <kbd>e</kbd> you can enter a url to navigate to,
            and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to navigate or as always <kbd>Escape</kbd> to cancel.
            The navigation bar will change color when text is entered.
            An orange border indicates the user input will be used to search with the search engine.
            A cyan border indicates that the entered text is detected as a website,
            which will result in a direct navigation.
            Suggestions from your browsing history will appear when typing.
            Webpages you visit often or those that match more closely with your search will appear at the top of the list.
            A green border is shown when a suggestion is selected, which also results in direct navigation.
            You can switch between the suggestions with <kbd>Tab</kbd> and <kbd>Shift with Tab</kbd>,
            after which you can select a suggestion by pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd>.
        </li>
        <li>
            <span class="insert">Insert</span>
            - This mode is used to interact with the website normally.
            It brings back mouse interaction and passes all keyboard inputs to the website.
            If the cursor is pointing at a url, the url will be shown at the bottom of the screen.
            However, insert mode should not be overused in Vieb,
            because a lot of the advantages Vieb has to offer are unavailable in this mode.
            If you really need or want to enter insert mode, press <kbd>i</kbd>.
            The follow(ing) mode describes a much faster way to follow links or buttons.
        </li>
        <li>
            <span class="follow">Follow</span>
            - Upon pressing <kbd>f</kbd> all links and buttons on the page will be assigned a key.
            When pressing the key next to a link, Vieb will click on the link.
            If there are a lot of links on the page, sometimes two keys are needed.
            You don't need to press these together, but simply after each other.
            To open links in a new tab, use <kbd>Shift with f</kbd> instead of <kbd>f</kbd>.
            Some buttons and other type of links can't be opened in a new tab.
            The different colors indicate the different type of links:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <a href="#follow">Regular link to the follow mode chapter</a>
                    will be outlined in blue.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Checkboxes and buttons
                    <input type="checkbox">
                    <button onclick="changeColor(this)">
                        Button
                    </button>
                    will be outlined in red.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <input type="text">
                    Text input fields will enter insert mode and will be outlined in green.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span onclick="changeColor(this)">
                        Elements with javascript event handlers
                    </span>
                    will be outlined in orange.
                </li>
            </ul>
            Press <kbd>f</kbd> to see the difference for the examples above.
            Remember that you can always go back to normal mode with <kbd>Escape</kbd>.
        </li>
        <li>
            <span class="command">Command</span>
            - Some functionality is accessed by executing commands.
            These can be entered after pressing <kbd>Shift with ;</kbd> (also known as <kbd>:</kbd>).
            A very important command is the quit command,
            as it's the only way to properly quit Vieb.
            For more detailed instructions on how to use this command,
            please refer to the dedicated paragraph <a href="#commands-quit">here</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
            <span class="search">Search</span>
            - This mode can be entered with <kbd>/</kbd>.
            After entering a string, press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to search for it.
            You can now press <kbd>n</kbd> or <kbd>Shift with n</kbd> to find next or previous matches.
            Searching is by default case-sensitive.
            When focussed on an element after searching, you can press <kbd>Enter</kbd> again to click on it.
        </li>
        <li>
            <span class="cursor">Cursor</span>
            - In this mode a blinking cursor will appear which can be moved around using Vim keybindings.
            If can also be used to hover over links or to scroll inside smaller scrollboxes.
            It's also possible to save images or preview url locations from this mode.
            It can be entered by pressing <kbd>c</kbd>.
            The complete list of movement options can be found <a href="#cursor">here</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
            <span class="visual">Visual</span>
            - This mode can only be entered from cursor mode using the <kbd>v</kbd> key.
            It can be used to select and copy text using the keyboad.
            When switching from cursor mode to visual mode,
            the exising location will be saved as the starting point for the selection.
            The cursor can then be moved freely similar to cursor mode,
            with text being selected between the two locations.
            Similar to all other modes, you can exit this mode using <kbd>Escape</kbd>,
            or by pressing <kbd>y</kbd> to copy the selected text.
        </li>
    </ul>
    Now that all the different modes have been explained,
    a separate paragraph will explain how to use the basics of normal mode.
    <h2 id="basics-normal">normal mode</h2>
    Most functionality is accessed from normal mode using the keyboard.
    It offers a large list of shortcuts to interact with the website.
    Aside from the keys to switch modes mentioned in the previous paragraph,
    these are the most important when in normal mode:
    <ul>
        <li>Moving around with a single press of <kbd>h j k l</kbd>.</li>
        <li>Zoom in and out using <kbd>Ctrl with +</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl with -</kbd>.</li>
        <li>Reset to the normal zoom level by pressing <kbd>Ctrl with 0</kbd>.</li>
        <li>Go back and forward in history using <kbd>Shift with h</kbd> and <kbd>Shift with l</kbd>.</li>
        <li>Open a new tab with <kbd>t</kbd>, which will enter nav mode.</li>
        <li>
            Switch between tabs with <kbd>w</kbd> and <kbd>b</kbd>
            or using <kbd>Shift with j</kbd> and <kbd>Shift with k</kbd>.
        </li>
        <li>Reload the page with <kbd>r</kbd> and without cache using <kbd>Shift with r</kbd>.</li>
        <li>Close a tab with the <kbd>d</kbd> key.</li>
        <li>Reopen a previously closed tab with <kbd>u</kbd>.</li>
    </ul>
    When you are done mastering these, please take a look at the
    <a href="#normal">complete list of them here</a>.
    <h2 id="basics-summary">summary</h2>
    This concludes the basic usage of Vieb.
    If anything is still unclear after reading this chapter,
    just try it out or read the dedicated chapter for it.
    If it's too much to remember at once, start with these:
    <ul>
        <li>This help page can ALWAYS be found by pressing <kbd>F1</kbd>.</li>
        <li>You can ALWAYS go back to normal mode with <kbd>Escape</kbd>.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1 id="settings">Settings</h1>
    Vieb has a lot of settings, including custom keybindings.
    The basics chapter assumes the keybindings mentioned are unchanged.
    This is because most users won't need to change them,
    and because it would make the basics chapter a lot more complex than it needs to be.
    There are two ways to change the settings:
    <ul>
        <li>Change the defaults using a viebrc.json file.</li>
        <li>Change a setting for just the current session, with :set.</li>
    </ul>
    The settings file is loaded on startup,
    and can be reloaded at anytime with the `:r` or `:reload` command.
    All settings in this file are optional and will override the default setting.
    Alternatively, settings can be changed for the current session with the `:set` command.
    For example, to use system notifications for as long as Vieb is running,
    open command mode with `:` and enter this command:
    <pre class="command-block">set notification.system true</pre>
    Vieb's set command syntax is different as compared to regular Vim,
    and always has the form of "set setting value".
    The settings file is case sensitive, just like the set command arguments.
    The keybindings and startup pages can only be changed with the settings file and not with the set command.
    Running the `:reload` command will reset any prior `:set` commands,
    because all settings will be reset and reapplied from the settings file.
    <h2 id="settings-viebrc">viebrc.json</h2>
    In this file you can change settings and the keybindings of Vieb.
    By default, this file does not exist and the original value for all settings will be used.
    Depending on your operating system, the location of this file will be different:
    <ul>
        <li>Windows - <kbd>%APPDATA%\Vieb\viebrc.json</kbd>
        <li>Mac - <kbd>~/Library/Application Support/Vieb/viebrc.json</kbd>
        <li>Linux - <kbd>~/.config/Vieb/viebrc.json</kbd>
    </ul>
    The same folder is used for all other information that Vieb stores,
    which means there should be electron/chromium related files there.
    You can create the viebrc.json file there if you haven't already.
    Your browsing and download history will also be saved in this folder by default.
    See the <a href="#history">history chapter</a> for more details and instructions how to configure the related settings.
    <h3 id="settings-viebrc-syntax">syntax</h3>
    The syntax of the settings file is json, as the name would suggest.
    This is very different from Vim for the following reasons:
    <ul>
        <li>Writing a vimscript parser would be a tedious task</li>
        <li>Most settings for Vim aren't present in Vieb and vice versa</li>
        <li>Support for it would never be as good as Vim</li>
    </ul>
    Basically, there are little advantages here staying true to Vim,
    while at the same time adding a lot of extra work.
    JSON can be parsed natively by JavaScript and is easy to understand,
    which is why all configuration of Vieb is done with it.
    <h3 id="settings-viebrc-defaults">defaults</h3>
    Looking at the default settings is really useful.
    It gives you an idea of all the available options,
    and which of them you actually want to change.

    <br>
    Your own viebrc.json file only needs to override these settings where needed,
    to change them to your liking.
    Note that by default <kbd>Ctrl with [</kbd> can be used as an alternative to
    <kbd>Escape</kbd> to return to normal mode.
    Finally, there are also example configs to replicate Firefox or Chromium.
    Please check the <a href="https://github.com/Jelmerro/Vieb">github page</a> for examples.
    They are stored in the examples folder and improvements are always welcome.
    <h3 id="settings-viebrc-keybindings">keybindings</h3>
    The viebrc is is the only place to change the keybindings.
    Changing them can be done by overwriting existing ones,
    or by adding completely new bindings.
    To remap a certain action, simply overwrite the old one with ""
    and create a new one with the same functionality.
    The identifiers for the keys are Vieb specific,
    and are a combination of the active modifiers and the JavaScript key.code.
    There is a third-party website where you can check the code for the key being pressed,
    which can be found <a href="https://keycode.info">here</a>.
    Make sure to enter insert mode and look at the "event.code" field.
    Once you know the keycode, you can combine it with the modifiers like so:
    <ul>
        <li><kbd>C-KeyQ</kbd> means to press Ctrl with q.</li>
        <li><kbd>CS-KeyT</kbd> means to press Ctrl and Shift with t.</li>
        <li><kbd>F1</kbd> means to only press F1 without any other key.</li>
        <li>
            <kbd>CSMA-F2</kbd>
            means to hold Ctrl, Shift, Meta and Alt while pressing F2.
        </li>
    </ul>
    Please note that the order of the modifiers is important,
    and that they are always in uppercase.
    This means that <kbd>sc-KeyT</kbd> and <kbd>SC-KeyT</kbd> won't work,
    but <kbd>CS-KeyT</kbd> will.

    This example results in the following changes as compared to the defaults,
    with the setting name listed between brackets:
    <ul>
        <li>
            The help page can't be accessed directly from insert mode with the
            <kbd>F1</kbd> key anymore (keybindings.insert.F1)
        </li>
        <li>
            Toggle between nav and normal mode with
            <kbd>F6</kbd>, similar to regular browsers (keybindings.nav.F6 and keybindings.normal.F6)
        </li>
        <li>
            <kbd>Escape</kbd> can not be used to exit insert mode,
            but <kbd>Ctrl with [</kbd> will still work (keybindings.insert.Escape)
        </li>
        <li><kbd>Ctrl with q</kbd> can be used to quit Vieb when in normal mode (keybindings.normal.C-KeyQ)</li>
        <li>Https connections will now be downgraded to http if the server has no certificate (redirectToHttp)</li>
        <li>
            The search engine will be google instead of the default duckduckgo.
            Please note that the search string will be pasted at the end of the search setting (search)
        </li>
        <li>Change the search mode to be case-insensitive (caseSensitiveSearch)</li>
        <li>Don't clear the cache when quiting Vieb (clearCacheOnQuit)</li>
        <li>Clear all cookies when exiting Vieb (clearCookiesOnQuit)</li>
        <li>Clear the localstorage when exiting Vieb (clearLocalStorageOnQuit)</li>
        <li>Don't suggest/autocomplete commands when in command mode (suggestCommands)</li>
        <li>Allow the entering of follow mode during page loads, even if elements might move around (allowFollowModeDuringLoad)</li>
        <li>Increase the font size of all UI elements to 20px instead of 14px (fontSize)</li>
        <li>Stop the digit keys from repeating actions (digitsRepeatActions)</li>
        <li>Ads and trackers will still be blocked, but the lists will be automatically updated (adblocker)</li>
        <li>This will stop the tabs from opening next to the current one using <kbd>t</kbd>, <kbd>Ctrl with t</kbd> will do the opposite of the current setting (addTabsNextToCurrentOne)</li>
        <li>Reduce the notification duration to 3 seconds instead of 6 (notification.duration)</li>
        <li>Display the notification in the bottom left instead of the bottom right (notification.position)</li>
        <li>Downloads will be stored in the documents folder, except if method is set be "ask" (downloads.path)</li>
        <li>Change the download method to "confirm" instead of "automatic" (downloads.method)</li>
        <li>Automatically remove downloads from the download history once they are completely downloaded (downloads.removeCompleted)</li>
        <li>Clear the entire download history when quiting Vieb (downloads.clearOnQuit)</li>
        <li>Don't suggest previously visited websites from the browsing history when in nav mode (history.suggest)</li>
        <li>Clear the browsing history when exiting Vieb (history.clearOnQuit)</li>
        <li>Stop adding newly visited webpages to the browsing history (history.storeNewVisits)</li>
        <li>Don't restore the previously open tabs when restarting Vieb (tabs.restore)</li>
        <li>The recently closed tabs will no longer be restorable with the <kbd>u</kbd> key (tabs.keepRecentlyClosed)</li>
        <li>Open this help page on startup, which can be expanded with other urls (tabs.startup)</li>
        <li>The position of the window when not maximized will not be remembered and restored after restarting (windowstate.position)</li>
        <li>The size of the window when not maximized will not be restored after restarting (windowstate.size)</li>
        <li>After restarting, Vieb will no longer remember if the window was maximized (windowstate.maximized)</li>
    </ul>
    Please note that the download, tab and browsing history are separately configured.
    Therefor it's possible to keep and restore the open tabs without keeping the other browsing history.
    More information about the history settings can be found in <a href="#history">the history chapter</a>.
    To find the right setting for you, the set command can be used at runtime to test a specific setting.
    This concludes the documentation regarding the viebrc file.
    In the next paragraph, the set command will be explained.
    <h2 id="settings-set">set command</h2>
    The set command can be used to change the settings after startup.
    When starting Vieb, the settings file is loaded and merged with the defaults.
    After that, most settings can be changed using the set command.
    For example, to use system notifications instead of Vieb's own notification system,
    go to command mode using <kbd>Shift with ;</kbd> (or <kbd>:</kbd>) and enter this command:
    <pre class="command-block">set notification.system true</pre>
    The set command always takes two arguments;
    one for the setting name and the other for the new value.
    The set command along with other commands has autocompletion by default,
    which helps with finding the right setting name.
    Settings can be changed as many times as you like,
    and can be reset and reloaded from the settings file with:
    <pre class="command-block">reload</pre> or just "r" for short.
    If the settings file was not changed after startup,
    running this command will results in the settings being reset to startup configuration.
    This means that it's a fast way to undo any set commands,
    but it can also be used to change the keybindings at runtime.
    To achieve this, simple edit the viebrc.json after Vieb was started,
    and use the reload command to apply all changes.
    Vieb only reads the settings file on startup and with the reload command,
    and never writes to the file as the set command is for runtime only.
    This means it's always safe to edit the viebrc file.
    <h3 id="settings-set-validation">validation</h3>
    The set command can be a useful tool to help with finding the right settings.
    Unlike the settings file, which will simply ignore errors and use the default,
    the set command informs the user of any mistakes made.
    For example, to disable the case sensitive search,
    the correct command would be:
    <pre class="command-block">set caseSensitiveSearch false</pre>
    If we would try to set the value to anything other than true or false,
    a warning would be displayed that a boolean is expected.
    All arguments are case sensitive, similar to the settings file.
    Lastly, if a command does not show a notification,
    it means that the command was successfully executed and applied.
    <h1 id="startup">Startup</h1>
    By default, all the tabs from the previous session will be opened (tabs.restore),
    along with the configured startup tabs (tabs.startup).
    This behaviour can be changed in settings as listed between the brackets.
    By default, your tabs will also be stored when closed (tabs.keepRecentlyClosed),
    so you can reopen them with <kbd>u</kbd>.
    When "tabs.restore" is disabled, but "tabs.keepRecentlyClosed" is enabled,
    all your open tabs will be moved to the recently closed tab list when quiting Vieb.
    When both settings are set to false, no tab history is preserved,
    and no closed tabs can be reopened as a result.
    These settings do not influence the other history settings,
    just like the history settings don't change the tab and startup behaviour.
    You can learn more about the history settings in <a href="#history">the history chapter</a>.
    <h2 id="startup-arguments">arguments</h2>
    Vieb can be started without any command-line arguments,
    but there are some available to use.
    First there is "--help" to display information about all the startup arguments.
    There is also a "--version" argument, to display the version and exit.
    Lastly, you can provide "--debug" or "--console" to open the Vieb debug console,
    which is the internal console of Vieb and not the one used to debug websites.
    For the website console, see the <a href="#commands-devtools">devtools command</a>.
    Arguments not starting with "-" will be parsed and opened as a url.
    These urls can take any form if you include the protocol/schema,
    or will automatically be prefixed with "https://".
    You can provide as many urls as you want,
    as each of them will be opened in a separate tab, similar to the tabs.startup setting.
    <h2 id="startup-examples">examples</h2>
    To get a better understanding of these arguments,
    there are a couple of examples shown in this paragraph.
    If you start Vieb with with npm,
    make sure you have already done "npm install" and run the following:
    <pre class="command-block">npm start -- --help</pre>
    This will passs the "--help" argument to Vieb,
    which should now display all the available startup arguments.
    Note that with npm it's required to separate the npm arguments from the Vieb arguments,
    by adding the extra "--" between them.
    To add arguments to a regular Vieb executable,
    simply add them like so:
    <pre class="command-block">vieb --help</pre>
    Where "vieb" should be the name of the executable,
    such as "Vieb.exe" on Windows.
    To open two websites on startup with Vieb's internal console open,
    you can start vieb with the following arguments:
    <pre class="command-block">
        vieb --console "http://example.com" "github.com/Jelmerro/Vieb"
    </pre>
    Note that the github url will be prefixed with "https://",
    because we omitted the schema/protocol from the url.
    <h1 id="normal">Normal mode</h1>
    In the basics chapter the most useful keyboard shortcuts are mentioned,
    but this chapter lists all of the default normal mode actions available:
    <ul>
        <li><kbd>F1</kbd> Opens this help page, similar to the help command.</li>
        <li><kbd>b</kbd> and <kbd>w</kbd> to switch to the previous and next tab.</li>
        <li>Alternatively, <kbd>Shift with j</kbd> and <kbd>Shift with k</kbd> can be used to switch tabs.</li>
        <li>Go to nav mode with <kbd>e</kbd>.</li>
        <li>Start the regular follow mode for the current tab with <kbd>f</kbd>.</li>
        <li>
            Use <kbd>F</kbd> to open supported links in a new tab.
            The <a href="#follow">follow</a> chapter explains the differences.
        </li>
        <li>Go to the top or the bottom of the page using <kbd>Shift with g</kbd> or <kbd>g g</kbd>.</li>
        <li>Jump to insert mode at the first text input by pressing <kbd>g i</kbd>.</li>
        <li>Move around on the page with the keys <kbd>h j k l</kbd>.</li>
        <li>Enter insert mode with <kbd>i</kbd>.</li>
        <li>Reload the page with or without cache using <kbd>r</kbd> and <kbd>Shift with r</kbd>.</li>
        <li>
            Open a new tab and enter nav mode in the new tab with <kbd>t</kbd>.
            By default this binding will open a new tab next to the current one.
            The position of the new tab can be configured with the setting (addTabsNextToCurrentOne).
        </li>
        <li>
            <kbd>Ctrl with t</kbd> can be used to open the tabs at the alternative position without changing the setting each time.
            By default this will open the new tab at the end of all the open tabs.
            If the alternative position (at the end instead of next to the current one) is preferred,
            you can change it by setting addTabsNextToCurrentOne to false.
        </li>
        <li>Open a new tab with the current website location prefilled in nav mode using <kbd>Shift with t</kbd>.</li>
        <li>Close the current tab with <kbd>d</kbd>.</li>
        <li>
            Reopen previously closed tabs with <kbd>u</kbd>.
            The position of the restored tab can be configured with the setting (addTabsNextToCurrentOne).
        </li>
        <li>Switch to search mode with <kbd>/</kbd>.</li>
        <li>
            Find the next or previous match when searching using
            <kbd>n</kbd> and <kbd>Shift with n</kbd>.
        </li>
        <li>When a search match is selected, press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to click on the selected search.</li>
        <li>
            Go forward or backwards in the tab browsing history using
            <kbd>Shift with l</kbd> and <kbd>Shift with h</kbd>.
        </li>
        <li>
            Alternatively, you can use
            <kbd>Ctrl with i</kbd> and <kbd>Ctrl with o</kbd> to navigate the history.
        </li>
        <li>
            Scroll half a page up or down using
            <kbd>Ctrl with u</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl with d</kbd>.
        </li>
        <li>Or an entire page by pressing <kbd>Ctrl with b</kbd> and <kbd>Ctrl with f</kbd>.</li>
        <li>To scroll an entire page horizontally, use <kbd>^</kbd> and <kbd>$</kbd> (shift 4 and 6).</li>
        <li>Go to command mode using <kbd>Shift with ;</kbd> (also known as <kbd>:</kbd>).</li>
        <li>Zoom in or out by pressing <kbd>Ctrl with +</kbd> and <kbd>Ctrl with -</kbd>.</li>
        <li>Reset the zoom to 100% again using <kbd>Ctrl with 0</kbd>.</li>
        <li>Enter <a href="#cursor">cursor mode</a> using <kbd>c</kbd>, <kbd>s</kbd> or <kbd>v</kbd>.</li>
    </ul>
    Aside from these, any number of digits can be entered before executing an action,
    which will result in the action being executed for the number of times entered.
    For example, pressing <kbd>2</kbd> and then <kbd>j</kbd> will result in scrolling down twice.
    This can be disabled by overwriting the action for any of the digits.
    To disable the repeat action behaviour entirely, set "digitsRepeatActions" to false in the settings.
    This repeat action behaviour is also present in <a href="#cursor">cursor</a> and <a href="#visual">visual</a> mode.
    <h1 id="follow">Follow mode</h1>
    This mode is a very important mode of Vieb,
    as it allows you to click on links or other elements using the keyboard.
    There are two versions with very different implementations,
    one for the current tab with <kbd>f</kbd> and one for new tab using <kbd>Shift with f</kbd>.
    These will be explained in separate paragraphs,
    as the underlying implementations are very different,
    even if the differences are not immediately visible to the user.
    <h2 id="follow-click">follow by click</h2>
    After pressing <kbd>f</kbd> from normal mode,
    all clickable elements should be assigned a key next to them.
    After choosing the key, Vieb will emulate a click on the chosen element.
    For the regular follow mode, these come in four flavours:
    <ul>
        <li>
            Regular anchor tags (a) outlined in blue -
            These will be clickable in regardless of the href attribute's value,
            even for href values such as "#".
            The result will be no different from clicking a link using a regular browser.
        </li>
        <li>
            Clickable input elements (checkboxes, radio and other buttons) outlined in red -
            These will be clicked on with no real differences compared to a regular browser.
        </li>
        <li>
            Input fields (textarea and inputs) outlined in green -
            These will be focused by clicking on them.
            Unlike other follow mode types,
            Vieb will not go back to normal mode but enter Insert mode directly.
            This allows you to start typing in the input field after choosing it with follow mode.
            When in normal mode, you can also jump to the first text input using <kbd>g i</kbd>.
        </li>
        <li>
            Onclick handlers outlined in orange -
            Elements with JavaScript event handlers will be made clickable.
            Both the onclick attribute and elements with event listeners are supported.
        </li>
    </ul>
    Clicking links with the mouse when using insert mode will mostly do the same thing.
    <h2 id="follow-newtab">follow in new tab</h2>
    The <kbd>Shift with f</kbd> key allows you to open links in a new tab.
    Unlike the regular follow mode, only anchor tabs will be available to click on.
    Aside from that, all the href attributes are filtered.
    The filter will disable the keys for links with no valid url,
    as these couldn't be opened in a new tab.
    This means only anchor tags with valid urls will be made clickable.
    Finally these links will not be opened by emulating a mouse click,
    but by opening a new tab with the href attribute as the url.
    <h1 id="cursor">Cursor mode</h1>
    Cursor mode can be used to move "cursor" using the keyboard.
    It is required to enter cursor mode before going to visual mode.
    To enter cursor mode, press <kbd>c</kbd>, <kbd>s</kbd> or <kbd>v</kbd> when in normal mode.
    When in cursor mode, hover events will be triggered when moving the cursor.
    If the cursor is pointing at a url, the url will be shown at the bottom of the screen.
    Aside from that, images can be downloaded and urls can be copied.
    Lastly, cursor mode can be used to scroll inside scrollable elements smaller than the main window.
    The following actions are available by default in cursor mode:
    <ul>
        <li>Use <kbd>h j k l</kbd> to move the cursor around.</li>
        <li>Press <kbd>y</kbd> to copy the current url under the cursor to the clipboard.</li>
        <li>You can download the image or svg at the current position using <kbd>d</kbd>.</li>
        <li>Execute a regular mouse click by pressing <kbd>f</kbd>.</li>
        <li>Start inspecting at the current cursor location with <kbd>e</kbd>.</li>
        <li>Click and enter insert mode at the cursor location using <kbd>i</kbd>.</li>
        <li>For middle and right-click, use <kbd>m</kbd> and <kbd>r</kbd> respectively.</li>
        <li>To jump a larger distance horizontally, use <kbd>w</kbd> and <kbd>b</kbd>.</li>
        <li>Press <kbd>g g</kbd> or <kbd>Shift with g</kbd> to scroll to the top or bottom of the page.</li>
        <li>Entering <kbd>Shift with h</kbd> or <kbd>Shift with l</kbd> will move the cursor to the top or bottom of the view.</li>
        <li>To execute a scrolling action at the current position, use <kbd>Shift with j</kbd> or <kbd>Shift with k</kbd>.</li>
        <li>The keys <kbd>^</kbd> and <kbd>$</kbd> will move the cursor to the end or the beginning of the view.</li>
        <li>Combining <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> with <kbd>h j k l</kbd> will move the cursor by one pixel in each direction.</li>
        <li>To move fast up and down, use <kbd>Ctrl with u</kbd> and <kbd>Ctrl with d</kbd>.</li>
        <li>Finally, pressing <kbd>v</kbd> when in cursor mode, will enter visual mode.</li>
    </ul>
    By default, <kbd>F1</kbd> is mapped to this help page for this and all other modes,
    similar to the default binding to go back to normal mode (<kbd>Escape</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl with [</kbd>).
    Some movemement actions will also scroll the window when reaching the bottom or top of the current view.
    <h1 id="visual">Visual mode</h1>
    This is the only mode than can not be directly entered from normal mode,
    but is instead entered after pressing <kbd>v</kbd> from cursor mode.
    The main purpose of this mode is to select and copy text.
    The full list of options looks like this:
    <ul>
        <li>Use <kbd>h j k l</kbd> to move the cursor around.</li>
        <li>To jump a larger distance horizontally, use <kbd>w</kbd> and <kbd>b</kbd>.</li>
        <li>Press <kbd>g g</kbd> or <kbd>Shift with g</kbd> to scroll to the top or bottom of the page.</li>
        <li>Entering <kbd>Shift with h</kbd> or <kbd>Shift with l</kbd> will move the cursor to the top or bottom of the view.</li>
        <li>To execute a scrolling action at the current position, use <kbd>Shift with j</kbd> or <kbd>Shift with k</kbd>.</li>
        <li>The keys <kbd>^</kbd> and <kbd>$</kbd> will move the cursor to the end or the beginning of the view.</li>
        <li>Combining <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> with <kbd>h j k l</kbd> will move the cursor by one pixel in each direction.</li>
        <li>To move fast up and down, use <kbd>Ctrl with u</kbd> and <kbd>Ctrl with d</kbd>.</li>
        <li>Finally, pressing <kbd>y</kbd> or <kbd>c</kbd> will copy the selection to the system clipboard.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1 id="commands">Commands</h1>
    In this chapter all the available commands will be listed and explained.
    By default, all supported commands will be autocompleted using a suggestions dropdown menu,
    similar to the nav mode suggestions.
    These suggestions can be disabled for commands by setting "suggestCommands" to false.
    The full list of commands is as follows:
    <ul>
        <li>help (or h)</li>
        <li>version (or v)</li>
        <li>downloads (or d)</li>
        <li>history</li>
        <li>accept (or confirm)</li>
        <li>reject (or deny)</li>
        <li>devtools (or dev)</li>
        <li>set</li>
        <li>reload (or r)</li>
        <li>quit (or q)</li>
    </ul>
    Each paragraph in this chapter will explain a single command from the list above.
    <h2 id="commands-help">help</h2>
    The help command can be used as an alternative for the <kbd>F1</kbd> key.
    It will open the help in the current tab,
    unless you are already on a different website.
    Optionally, the help command takes a single argument,
    which can be used to refer to a section of this help page.
    For example, to navigate to the basics chapter:
    <pre class="command-block">help basics</pre>
    This command can also be used when this help page is already open,
    as it will simply move the page to the right section.
    The help command can be shortened by only using "h".
    All paragraphs are prefixed with the chapter they are in,
    and as a result the current paragraph can be opened directly with:
    <pre class="command-block">h commands-help</pre>
    <h2 id="commands-version">version</h2>
    The version command takes no arguments.
    It is used to diplay version information about Vieb.
    There are versions listed for Vieb and Chromium,
    and you can also navigate to the github repository from the version page.
    The version command is also available as "v".
    <h2 id="commands-downloads">downloads</h2>
    The downloads command takes no arguments.
    The short version of this command is "d".
    This page can be used to view all the downloaded files.
    To learn more about the download page, different download methods and other special pages,
    check out the <a href="#special">Special pages</a>.
    <h2 id="commands-history">history</h2>
    The history command takes no arguments.
    This command will open a list of all the website visisted.
    To learn more about Vieb's history settings and configurations,
    see <a href="#special-history">history page info</a> or <a href="#history">the history chapter</a>.
    <h2 id="commands-accept">accept</h2>
    This command can be used to confirm a download request.
    It can only be used if the "confirm" download method is used.
    When this mode is active, no files will automatically download,
    but you will be asked to accept or reject the file.
    This command can also be called as: <pre class="command-block">confirm</pre>
    On the <a href="#special-downloads">downloads page</a> you can view a list of downloaded files,
    and also view the current unconfirmed download.
    <h2 id="commands-reject">reject</h2>
    This command can be used to reject the current unconfirmed download.
    It's usually not required to call this command,
    because new download requests will replace the old one.
    This command can also be called as: <pre class="command-block">deny</pre>
    <h2 id="commands-devtools">devtools</h2>
    The devtools command takes no arguments.
    This command can be used to open to open the developer tools for the current website.
    The short version of this command is "dev".
    To open the Vieb developer/debug console, see the <a href="#startup">startup options</a>.
    <h2 id="commands-set">set</h2>
    This command has already been mostly explained in <a href="#settings-set">this paragraph</a>.
    To summarize, this command can be used to set any setting during runtime,
    without saving it to the viebrc.json settings/config file.
    It is always in the form of:
    <pre class="command-block">set setting value</pre>
    For example, to increase the notification duration for the current session,
    use the following command (from 6 seconds to 10 seconds):
    <pre class="command-block">set notification.duration 10000</pre>
    If no notification is shown, the setting was successfully applied.
    Note that the duration and position of the notifications can only be changed
    if the Vieb notification is used instead of system notifications.
    Lastly, Vieb will automatically block websites with an invalid or missing certificate.
    To bypass this, either enter the url with the full protocol (http://),
    or change the following setting:
    <pre class="command-block">set redirectToHttp true</pre>
    <h2 id="commands-reload">reload</h2>
    The reload command can be used to reload the settings from the settings file.
    It takes no arguments, required or optional.
    All previous "set" command changes are reset by using reload,
    so it can be used to undo any unwanted changes made using the set command.
    It can also be used to change the <a href="#settings-viebrc-keybindings">keybindings</a>.
    or to change the settings permanently (instead of temporary using the "set" command).
    A short version of the reload command is just using "r".
    <h2 id="commands-quit">quit</h2>
    Last but not least is the quit command.
    This simple command takes no arguments,
    and is the proper way to quit Vieb.
    For beginners who haven't changed the related keybindings,
    these are the steps to quit Vieb regardless of mode:
    <ul>
        <li>Press <kbd>Escape</kbd> to go back to normal mode (Escape does nothing when already in normal mode).</li>
        <li>Use <kbd>Shift with ;</kbd> or <kbd>:</kbd> to enter command mode.</li>
        <li>Type "quit" into the navbar and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.</li>
    </ul>
    The short version of the quit command is "q".
    <h1 id="history">History</h1>
    Your browsing, download and tab history are automatically stored when using Vieb with the default settings.
    Each of these parts have separate settings to configure how and if they should store your history.
    <h2 id="history-browsing">browsing history</h2>
    All websites you visit are stored in a "hist" file inside Vieb's config folder.
    Everytime a page is loaded, the hist file is appended with a single line.
    By default, suggestions will be displayed when in nav mode.
    These suggestions are entirely based on websites you have previously visited.
    The navigation bar will turn green when a suggestion is selected,
    cyan for direct navigations and orange for search.
    Webpages you visit often or those that match more closely with your search will appear at the top of the list.
    These suggestions can be disabled by setting "history.suggest" to false.
    To change or disable the browsing history, there are two other settings:
    <ul>
        <li>
            history.clearOnQuit - when this setting is set to true,
            the browsing history is cleared when quiting Vieb.
            This will not clear the currently opened tabs or the download history,
            but only influences if the browsing history should be cleared on exit.
        </li>
        <li>
            history.storeNewVisits - when this setting is true,
            your browsing history is extended for every page you visit.
            This means that once a page is loaded, the url, the title and the date of the visit will be stored.
            When this setting is set to false, no new entries will be added for new site visits.
            This setting does not influence the previously stored history,
            or the download and tab history.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="history-other">other history stored</h2>
    The download settings are explained in the <a href="#special-downloads">special page</a> section.
    To learn more about the tab history settings, see the <a href="#startup">startup chapter</a>.
    Because these settings are split between downloads, tabs and browsing history,
    you can finetune what you want to store and when to clear it automatically.
    <h2 id="history-private">private mode</h2>
    Having separate history settings means that there is no traditional private window available in Vieb,
    but by configuring the right settings, something equivalent can be achieved.
    An example for this based on the default settings can be something like this:
    <ul>
        <li>Set "downloads.removeCompleted" to true</li>
        <li>Set "history.storeNewVisits" to false</li>
        <li>Set "tabs.keepRecentlyClosed" to false</li>
    </ul>
    The combination of these settings means that once a tab is closed, or a download is completed,
    Vieb has no history stored in any of the three categories.
    You can of course expand these three settings with more strict settings,
    such as the option to clear any download regardless of progress when quiting,
    or the setting to never store the tabs at all by disabling the "tabs.restore" setting.
    By default, command mode will suggest and autocomplete settings that can be configured,
    which aims to make it easier to set these settings at runtime.
    Of course it's also possible to store these settings permanently in the viebrc config file.
    Both of these ways to change the settings are explained <a href="#settings">settings chapter</a>.
    <h1 id="adblocker">Adblocker</h1>
    Vieb includes an adblocker made by cliqz (see <a href="#mentions">mentions</a> for details).
    By default, the easylist and easyprivacy filter lists are included and enabled with Vieb.
    The lists will only be updated when a new Vieb released,
    unless you change the adblocker setting.
    The adblocker setting can only be changed using the viebrc config file.
    There are four different options for the adblocker setting:
    <ul>
        <li>off - The adblocker won't be loaded, and no ads will be blocked</li>
        <li>
            static (default) - The adblocker will be loaded and block ads using built-in lists,
            but won't automatically update the easylist and easyprivacy filters.
            The lists will only be updated when downloading a new version of Vieb from the releases page.
            Additional lists can still be added as explained below.
        </li>
        <li>
            update - The adblocker will be loaded and block ads using built-in lists,
            but also automatically download the latest easylist and easyprivacy filter lists on startup.
            This is not the default, because connections to a third-party site should be opt-in.
            Additional lists can still be added as explained below.
        </li>
        <li>
            custom - The adblocker will only load when lists are added manually.
            This option should be used in case you don't want to use the easylist and easyprivacy lists,
            but still want Vieb to block ads and/or trackers based on other filter lists.
            If this option is chosen after Vieb was started with this setting on "static" or "update",
            you should check the "blocklists" folder for lists you might not want to use.
        </li>
    </ul>
    Regardless of the chosen option, you can add new lists to the "blocklists" subfolder inside the Vieb config folder,
    but only "custom" allows you to remove the easylist and easyprivacy filter lists.
    In case you want to add a different filter list, make sure it has the right extension and syntax,
    or go to <a href="https://easylist.to">easylist.to</a> for more information about these lists.
    <h1 id="special">Special pages</h1>
    Vieb has a couple of special pages that can be accessed like so "vieb://help".
    Most of these pages also have a dedicated command to navigate to them,
    but using nav mode to go there is possible as well.
    Each special page will be explained below.
    <h2 id="special-help">help page</h2>
    This is the current page and also a complete reference of Vieb's functionality.
    The location of this special page is <a href="">"vieb://help"</a>.
    You can link to specific section of this page using "vieb://help#basics",
    or by calling the <a href="#commands-help">help command</a> with extra arguments.
    <h2 id="special-downloads">downloads page</h2>
    This page displays a list of all the downloaded files using Vieb.
    The list is stored between sessions by default,
    but there are two related settings to change this behaviour:
    <ul>
        <li>
            downloads.removeCompleted -
            This setting can be set to true in case you want to remove all completed downloads from the list.
            You will still get a notification when a download is done,
            but it won't stay in the download history.
            Progressing or cancelled downloads will still be listed, even between sessions.
        </li>
        <li>
            downloads.clearOnQuit -
            This setting can be set to true if you want to clear the list on quit.
            When set to true, no download history will be saved to disk.
            The tab and browsing history are configured separately.
        </li>
    </ul>
    There are three different download methods in Vieb (setting: "downloads.method"):
    <ul>
        <li>
            automatic (default) - which will download all files automatically similar to chromium,
            the configured "downloads.path" will be used to store all downloads.
        </li>
        <li>
            ask - when this mode is active, the download path will not be used,
            but instead a file explorer will be displayed to ask for the download location.
        </li>
        <li>
            confirm - in this mode the :accept and :reject commands are used to confirm a download.
            On the downloads page the current unconfirmed download is shown.
            As with the automatic download setting, the "downloads.path" location is used to store the download.
        </li>
    </ul>
    All downloads regardless of mode will be displayed on the downloads page,
    which can also be accsed as "vieb://downloads" or with the <a href="#commands-downloads">downloads command</a>.
    <h2 id="special-version">version page</h2>
    This page contains the current Vieb version and a button to check for updates.
    It can be accessed with the :version command (:v), or as "vieb://version".
    <h2 id="special-history">history page</h2>
    On this page you can find all your browsing history.
    The page is sorted by date and contains breakpoints such as "Today" or "This hour",
    which you can jump to directly using the links at the top.
    There is also the option to delete specific pages from your history,
    or you can delete an entire day, week or everything.
    The history page can be opened using the <a href="#commands-history">history command</a>, or as "vieb://history".
    To change the history settings, see the <a href="#history">history chapter</a>.

        <div>Welcome to Vieb</div>
    </div>
    <h1 id="intro">Intro</h1>
    Welcome to Vieb's official, complete and offline documentation.
    You can ALWAYS come back to this page using <kbd>F1</kbd> from ANY mode.
    The documentation consists of a single page, separated into sections.
    These sections can be accessed using the table of contents,
    or by using the help command with the section as the first argument.
    If you don't understand what commands are,
    please read the first chapter called "Basics" to get started with Vieb.
    You can go there with two simple steps:
    <ul>
        <li>Press <kbd>Escape</kbd> once to make sure you are in normal mode.</li>
        <li>Now scroll up and down with <kbd>k</kbd> and <kbd>j</kbd>.</li>
    </ul>
    Please make sure to read that chapter if you are confused by anything so far,
    such as the lack of mouse interaction with the webpage.
    <p>
        Vieb is short for "Vim Inspired Electron Browser" and can be found on
        <a href="https://github.com/Jelmerro/Vieb">github</a>.
    </p>
    <h1 id="contents">Contents</h1>
    <div class="toc">
    </div>
    <h1 id="basics">Basics</h1>
    Interaction with Vieb is heavily focused on the keyboard,
    and is mostly inspired by the popular text editor Vim.
    If you think a key is mapped to a weird keyboard combination,
    it's probably because it's also weird in Vim.
    Clicking links, scrolling, navigating,
    and most other tasks have dedicated keyboard shortcuts.
    The most important ones will be explained in this chapter.
    If a key such as <kbd>f</kbd> is displayed as <kbd>F</kbd>,
    you are expected to press shift and f together.
    Other modifiers such as ctrl will be displayed like so: <kbd>Ctrl with [</kbd>.
    <h2 id="basics-modes">modes</h2>
    Vieb uses different modes to separate functionality.
    By default, you should be in normal mode,
    but you can go back to normal mode at any time by pressing <kbd>Escape</kbd>.
    The mode is always prominently displayed in the navbar,
    between the Vieb logo and the url input.
    Modes can be switched to by pressing a certain key from normal mode.
    Aside from normal mode, the following modes are available:
    <ul>
        <li>
            <span class="nav">Nav</span>
            - Upon pressing <kbd>e</kbd> you can enter a url to navigate to,
            and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to navigate or as always <kbd>Escape</kbd> to cancel.
        </li>
        <li>
            <span class="insert">Insert</span>
            - This mode is used to interact with the website normally.
            It brings back mouse interaction and passes all keyboard inputs to the website.
            This mode shouldn't be used by default,
            because a lot of the advantages Vieb has to offer are unavailable in this mode.
            If you really need or want to enter insert mode, press <kbd>i</kbd>.
            The follow(ing) mode describes a much faster way to use insert mode.
        </li>
        <li>
            <span class="follow">Follow</span>
            - Upon pressing <kbd>f</kbd> all links on the page will be assigned a key.
            When pressing the key next to a link, Vieb will click on the link.
            If there are a lot of links on the page, sometimes two keys are needed.
            You don't need to press these together, but simply after each other.
            To open links in a new tab, use <kbd>F</kbd> instead of <kbd>f</kbd>.
            Some buttons and other type of links can't be opened in a new tab.
            The different colors indicate the different type of links:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <a href="#basics">Regular link to this chapter</a>
                    will be outlined in blue.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Checkboxes and buttons
                    <input type="checkbox">
                    <button onclick="changeColor(this)">
                        Button
                    </button>
                    will be outlined in red.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <input type="text">
                    Text input fields will enter insert mode and will be outlined in green.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span onclick="changeColor(this)">
                        Elements with javascript event handlers
                    </span>
                    will be outlined in orange.
                </li>
            </ul>
            Press <kbd>f</kbd> to see the difference for the examples above.
            Remember that you can always go back to normal mode with <kbd>Escape</kbd>.
        </li>
        <li>
            <span class="command">Command</span>
            - Some functionality is accessed by executing commands.
            These can be entered after pressing <kbd>:</kbd> (this requires shift).
            A very important command is the quit command,
            as it's the only way to properly quit Vieb.
            For more detailed instructions on how to use this command,
            please refer to the dedicated paragraph <a href="#commands-quit">here</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
            <span class="search">Search</span>
            - This mode can be entered with <kbd>/</kbd>.
            After entering a string, press enter to search for it.
            You can now press <kbd>n</kbd> or <kbd>N</kbd> to find next or previous matches.
            Searching is by default case-sensitive.
        </li>
    </ul>
    Now that all the different special modes have been explained,
    a separate paragraph will explain how to use normal mode.
    <h2 id="basics-normal">normal mode</h2>
    Most functionality is accessed from normal mode,
    and all modes can be entered from normal mode.
    It offers a large list of shortcuts to interact with the website.
    Aside from the keys to switch modes mentioned in the previous paragraph,
    these keybindings are important when in normal mode:
    <ul>
        <li>Moving around with a single press of <kbd>h j k l</kbd>.</li>
        <li>Zoom in and out with <kbd>Ctrl with +</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl with -</kbd>.</li>
        <li>Reset to the normal zoom level with <kbd>Ctrl with 0</kbd>.</li>
        <li>Go back and forward in history using <kbd>H</kbd> and <kbd>L</kbd>.</li>
        <li>Open a new tab with <kbd>t</kbd>, which will enter nav mode.</li>
        <li>
            Switch between tabs with <kbd>w</kbd> and <kbd>b</kbd>
            or with <kbd>J</kbd> and <kbd>K</kbd>.
        </li>
        <li>Reload the page with <kbd>r</kbd> and without cache using <kbd>R</kbd>.</li>
        <li>Close a tab with the <kbd>d</kbd> key.</li>
    </ul>
    When you are done mastering these, please take a look at the
    <a href="#normal">complete list of them here</a>.
    <h2 id="basics-summary">summary</h2>
    This concludes the basic usage of Vieb.
    If anything is still unclear after reading this chapter,
    just try it out or read the dedicated chapter for it.
    If it's too much to remember at once, start with these:
    <ul>
        <li>This help page can ALWAYS be found by pressing <kbd>F1</kbd>.</li>
        <li>You can ALWAYS go back to normal mode with <kbd>Escape</kbd>.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1 id="settings">Settings</h1>
    An important part of Vieb that was skipped in the basics chapter,
    is the ability to change the settings.
    This is because most users won't need to change them,
    and because the keybindings can be changed, removed or added,
    which would make the basics chapter a lot more complex than it needs to be.
    There are two ways to change the settings:
    <ul>
        <li>Change the defaults using a viebrc.json file.</li>
        <li>Change a setting for just the current session, with :set.</li>
    </ul>
    The settings file is loaded on startup,
    and can be reloaded at anytime with the `:r` or `:reload` command.
    All settings in this file are optional and will override the default setting.
    Alternatively, settings can be changed for the current session with the `:set` command.
    For example, to use system notifications for as long as Vieb is running,
    open command mode with `:` and enter this command:
    <pre class="command-block">set notification.system true</pre>
    Vieb's set command syntax is different as compared to regular Vim,
    and always has the form of "set setting value".
    The settings file is case sensitive, but the setting argument of the set command isn't.
    The keybindings can only be changed with the settings file and not with the set command.
    Running the `:reload` command will reset any prior `:set` commands,
    because all settings will be reset and reapplied from the settings file.
    <h2 id="settings-viebrc">viebrc.json</h2>
    In this file you can change settings and the keybindings of Vieb.
    By default, this file does not exist and the original value for all settings will be used.
    Depending on your operating system, the location of this file will be different:
    <ul>
        <li>Windows - <kbd>%APPDATA%\Vieb\viebrc.json</kbd>
        <li>Mac - <kbd>~/Library/Application Support/viebrc.json</kbd>
        <li>Linux - <kbd>~/.config/Vieb/viebrc.json</kbd>
    </ul>
    The same folder is used for all other information that Vieb stores,
    which means there should be electron/chromium related files there.
    You can create the viebrc.json file there if you haven't already.
    <h3 id="settings-viebrc-syntax">syntax</h3>
    The syntax of the settings file is json, as the name would suggest.
    This is very different from Vim for the following reasons:
    <ul>
        <li>Writing a vimscript parser would be a tedious task</li>
        <li>Most settings for Vim aren't present in Vieb and vice versa</li>
        <li>Support for it would never be as good as Vim</li>
    </ul>
    Basically, there are little advantages here staying true to Vim,
    while at the same time adding a lot of extra work.
    JSON can be parsed natively by JavaScript and is easy to understand,
    which is why all configuration of Vieb is done with it.
    <h3 id="settings-viebrc-defaults">defaults</h3>
    Looking at the default settings is really useful.
    It gives you an idea of all the available options,
    and which of them you actually want to change.
    <br>
    <iframe src="../default-settings.json" frameborder="0"
        scrolling="no" onload="configureIframe(this)">
    </iframe>
    <br>
    Your own viebrc.json file only needs to override these settings where needed,
    to change them to your liking.
    Note that by default <kbd>Ctrl with [</kbd> can be used as an alternative to <kbd>Escape</kbd>,
    to return to normal mode.
    Finally, there are also example configs to replicate Firefox or Chromium.
    Please check the <a href="https://github.com/Jelmerro/Vieb">github page</a> for examples.
    <h3 id="settings-viebrc-keybindings">keybindings</h3>
    The viebrc is is the only place to change the keybindings.
    Changing them can be done by overwriting existing ones,
    or by adding completely new bindings.
    To remap a certain action, simply overwrite the old one with ""
    and create a new one with the same functionality.
    The identifiers for the keys are Vieb specific,
    and are a combination of the active modifiers and the JavaScript key.code.
    There is a third-party website where you can check the code for the key being pressed,
    which can be found <a href="https://keycode.info">here</a>.
    Make sure to enter insert mode and look at the "event.code" field.
    Once you know the keycode, you can combine it with the modifiers like so:
    <ul>
        <li><kbd>C-KeyQ</kbd> means to press Ctrl with q.</li>
        <li><kbd>CS-KeyT</kbd> means to press Ctrl and Shift with t.</li>
        <li><kbd>F1</kbd> means to only press F1 without any other key.</li>
        <li>
            <kbd>CSMA-F2</kbd>
            means to hold Ctrl, Shift, Meta and Alt while pressing F2.
        </li>
    </ul>
    Please note that the order of the modifiers is important,
    and that they are always in uppercase.
    This means that <kbd>sc-KeyT</kbd> and <kbd>SC-KeyT</kbd> won't work,
    but <kbd>CS-KeyT</kbd> will.
    <h3 id="settings-viebrc-example">example</h3>
    <pre>
{
    "keybindings": {
        "nav": {
            "F6": "ACTIONS.toNormalMode"
        },
        "insert": {
            "F1": "",
            "Escape": ""
        },
        "normal": {
            "F6": "ACTIONS.toNavMode",
            "C-KeyQ": "COMMAND.quit"
        }
    },
    "redirectToHttp": true,
    "search": "https://google.com/search?q=",
    "caseSensitiveSearch": false,
    "notification": {
        "duration": 3000,
        "position": "bottom-left"
    },
    "downloads": {
        "method": "confirm",
        "path": "~/Documents"
    }
}</pre>

    This example results in the following changes:
    <ul>
        <li>
            The help page can't be accessed directly from insert mode with the
            <kbd>F1</kbd> key anymore.
        </li>
        <li>
            Toggle between nav and normal mode with
            <kbd>F6</kbd> (similar to regular browsers)
        <li>
            <kbd>Escape</kbd> can not be used to exit insert mode,
            but <kbd>Ctrl with [</kbd> will still work.
        </li>
        <li><kbd>Ctrl with q</kbd> can be used to quit Vieb when in normal mode.</li>
        <li>Https connections will now be downgraded to http if the server has no certificate.</li>
        <li>
            The search engine will be google instead of the default duckduckgo.
            Please note that the search string will be pasted at the end of the search setting.
        </li>
        <li>Change the search mode to be case-insensitive.</li>
        <li>Reduce the notification duration to 3 seconds instead of 5.</li>
        <li>Display the notification in the bottom left instead of the bottom right.</li>
        <li>Change the download method to "confirm" instead of "automatic"</li>
        <li>Downloads will be stored in the documents folder, except if method would be "ask"
    </ul>
    This concludes the documentation regarding the viebrc file.
    In the next paragraph, the set command will be explained.
    <h2 id="settings-set">set command</h2>
    The set command can be used to change the settings after startup.
    When starting Vieb, the settings file is loaded and merged with the defaults.
    After that, all settings (not the keybindings) can be changed using the set command.
    For example, to use system notifications instead of Vieb's own notification system,
    go to command mode with <kbd>:</kbd> and enter this command:
    <pre class="command-block">set notifications.system true</pre>
    The set command always takes two arguments;
    one for the setting name and the other for the new value.
    Settings can be changed as many times as you like,
    and can be reset and reloaded from the settings file with:
    <pre class="command-block">reload</pre> or just "r" for short.
    If the settings file was not changed after startup,
    running this command will results in the settings being reset to startup configuration.
    This means that it's a fast way to undo any set commands,
    but it can also be used to change the keybindings at runtime.
    To achieve this, simple edit the viebrc.json after Vieb was started,
    and use the reload command to apply all changes.
    Vieb only reads the settings file on startup and with the reload command,
    and never writes to the file as the set command is for runtime only.
    This means it's always safe to edit the viebrc file.
    <h3 id="settings-set-validation">validation</h3>
    The set command can be a useful tool to help with finding the right settings.
    Unlike the settings file, which will simply ignore errors and use the default,
    the set command informs the user of any mistakes made.
    For example, to disable the case sensitive search,
    the correct command would be:
    <pre class="command-block">set caseSensitiveSearch false</pre>
    If we would try to set the value to anything other than true or false,
    a warning would be displayed that only true and false are accepted values.
    The first argument is case insensitive, while the value is case sensitive.
    This means that the previous set command could also be entered like this:
    <pre class="command-block">set casesensitiveSEARCH false</pre>
    But writing false in uppercase would result in a warning.
    Lastly, if a command does not show a notification,
    it means that the command was succesfully executed and applied.
    <h1 id="startup">Startup</h1>
    Vieb can be started without any required arguments.
    This will result in this help page being opened,
    because there is no history management yet to (optionally) restore the previous tabs from.
    There is already the option to add startup arguments,
    which can be used for a couple of different things.
    First there is "--help" to display information about all the startup options.
    There is also a "--version" argument, to display the version and exit.
    Lastly, you can provide "--debug" or "--console" to open the Vieb debug console,
    which is the internal console of Vieb and not the one used to debug websites.
    Aside from these arguments the remaining ones will be opened as a url.
    For the website console, see the <a href="#commands-devtools">devtools command</a>.
    These urls can take any form if you include the protocol/schema,
    or will automatically be prefixed with "https://".
    You can provide as many urls as you want,
    as each of them will be opened in a separate tab.
    <h2 id="startup-examples">examples</h2>
    To get a better understanding of these arguments,
    there are a couple of examples shown in this paragraph.
    If you start Vieb with with npm,
    make sure you have already done "npm install" and run the following:
    <pre class="command-block">npm start -- --help</pre>
    This will passs the "--help" argument to Vieb,
    which should now display all the available startup arguments.
    Note that with npm it's required to separate the npm arguments from the Vieb arguments,
    by adding the extra "--" between them.
    To add arguments to a regular Vieb executable,
    simply add them like so:
    <pre class="command-block">vieb --help</pre>
    Where "vieb" should be the name of the executable,
    such as "Vieb.exe" on Windows.
    To open two websites on startup with Vieb's internal console open,
    you can start vieb with the following arguments:
    <pre class="command-block">
        vieb --console "http://example.com" "github.com/Jelmerro/Vieb"
    </pre>
    Note that the github url will be prefixed with "https://",
    because we omitted the schema/protocol from the url.
    <h1 id="normal">Normal mode</h1>
    In the basics chapter the most useful keyboard shortcuts are mentioned,
    but this chapter lists all of the default normal mode actions available:
    <ul>
        <li><kbd>F1</kbd> Opens this help page, similar to the help command.</li>
        <li><kbd>b</kbd> and <kbd>w</kbd> to switch to the previous and next tab</kbd>.</li>
        <li>Alternatively, <kbd>J</kbd> and <kbd>K</kbd> can be used to switch tabs.</li>
        <li>Go to nav mode with <kbd>e</kbd>.</li>
        <li>Start the regular follow mode for the current tab with <kbd>f</kbd>.</li>
        <li>
            Use <kbd>F</kbd> to open supported links in a new tab.
            The <a href="#follow">follow</a> chapter explains the differences.
        </li>
        <li>Go to the top or the bottom of the page with <kbd>G</kbd> or <kbd>g</kbd>.</li>
        <li>Move around on the page with the keys <kbd>h j k l</kbd>.</li>
        <li>Enter insert mode with <kbd>I</kbd>.</li>
        <li>
            Find the next or previous match when searching with
            <kbd>n</kbd> and <kbd>N</kbd>.
        </li>
        <li>Reload the page with or without cache using <kbd>r</kbd> and <kbd>R</kbd>.</li>
        <li>Open a new tab and enter nav mode in the new tab with <kbd>t</kbd>.</li>
        <li>Switch to search mode with <kbd>/</kbd>.</li>
        <li>
            Go forward or backwards in the tab browsing history with
            <kbd>L</kbd> and <kbd>H</kbd>.
        </li>
        <li>
            Scroll half a page up or down using
            <kbd>Ctrl with u</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl with d</kbd>.
        </li>
        <li>Or an entire page by pressing <kbd>Ctrl with b</kbd> and <kbd>Ctrl with f</kbd>.</li>
        <li>Go to command mode with <kbd>:</kbd>.</li>
        <li>Zoom in or out using <kbd>Ctrl with +</kbd> and <kbd>Ctrl with -</kbd>.</li>
        <li>Reset the zoom to 100% again using <kbd>Ctrl with 0</kbd>.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1 id="follow">Follow</h1>
    This mode is a very important aspect of Vieb,
    as it allows you to click on links or other elements using the keyboard.
    There are two versions with very different implementations,
    one for the current tab with <kbd>f</kbd> and one for new tab with <kbd>F</kbd>.
    These will be explained in separate paragraphs,
    as the underlying implementations are very different,
    even if the differences are not immediately visible to the user.
    <h2 id="follow-click">follow by click</h2>
    After pressing <kbd>f</kbd> from normal mode,
    all clickable elements should be assigned a key next to them.
    After choosing the key, Vieb will emulate a click on the chosen element.
    For the regular follow mode, these come in four flavours:
    <ul>
        <li>
            Regular anchor tags (a) outlined in blue -
            These will be clickable in regardless of the href attribute's value,
            even for href values such as "#".
            The result will be no different from clicking a link using a regular browser.
        </li>
        <li>
            Clickable input elements (checkboxes, radio and other buttons) outlined in red -
            These will be clicked on with no real differences compared to a regular browser.
        </li>
        <li>
            Input fields (textarea and inputs) outlined in green -
            These will be focused by clicking on them.
            Unlike other follow mode types,
            Vieb will not bo back to normal mode but enter Insert mode directly.
            This allows you to start typing in the input field after choosing it with follow mode.
        </li>
        <li>
            Onclick handlers outlined in orange -
            Elements with JavaScript event handlers will be made clickable.
            Both the onclick attribute and elements with event listeners are supported.
        </li>
    </ul>
    Clicking links with the mouse when using insert mode will mostly do the same thing.
    <h2 id="follow-newtab">follow in new tab</h2>
    The <kbd>F</kbd> key allows you to open links in a new tab.
    Unlike the regular follow mode, only anchor tabs will be available to click on.
    Aside from that, all the href attributes are filtered.
    The filter will disable the keys for links with no valid url,
    as these couldn't be opened in a new tab.
    This means only anchor tags with valid urls will be made clickable.
    Finally these links will not be opened by emulating a mouse click,
    but by opening a new tab with the href attribute as the url.
    <h1 id="commands">Commands</h1>
    In this chapter all the available commands will be listed and explained.
    <h2 id="commands-help">help</h2>
    The help command can be used as an alternative for the <kbd>F1</kbd> key.
    It will open the help in the current tab,
    unless you are already on a different website.
    Optionally, the help command takes a single argument,
    which can be used to refer to a section of this help page.
    For example, to navigate to the basics chapter:
    <pre class="command-block">help basics</pre>
    This command can also be used when this help page is already open,
    as it will simply move the page to the right section.
    The help command can be shortened by only using "h".
    All paragraphs are prefixed with the chapter they are in,
    and as a result the current paragraph can be opened directly with:
    <pre class="command-block">h commands-help</pre>
    <h2 id="commands-version">version</h2>
    The version command takes no arguments.
    It is used to diplay version information about Vieb.
    There are versions listed for Vieb and Chromium,
    and you can also navigate to the github repository from the version page.
    The version command is also available as "v".
    <h2 id="commands-downloads">downloads</h2>
    The downloads command takes no arguments.
    The short version of this command is "d".
    This page can be used to view all the downloaded files.
    To learn more about the download page, different download methods and other special pages,
    check out the <a href="#special">Special pages</a>.
    <h2 id="commands-accept">accept</h2>
    This command can be used to confirm a download request.
    It can only be used if the "confirm" download method is used.
    When this mode is active, no files will automatically download,
    but you will be asked to accept or reject the file.
    This command can also be called as: <pre class="command-block">confirm</pre>
    On the <a href="#special-downloads">downloads page</a> you can view a list of downloaded files,
    and also view the current unconfirmed download.
    <h2 id="commands-reject">reject</h2>
    This command can be used to reject the current unconfirmed download.
    It's usually not required to call this command,
    because new download requests will replace the old one.
    This command can also be called as: <pre class="command-block">deny</pre>
    <h2 id="commands-devtools">devtools</h2>
    The devtools command takes no arguments.
    This command can be used to open to open the developer tools for the current website.
    The short version of this command is "dev".
    To open the Vieb developer/debug console, see the <a href="#startup">startup options</a>.
    <h2 id="commands-set">set</h2>
    This command has already been mostly explained in <a href="#settings-set">this paragraph</a>.
    To summarize, this command can be used to set any setting during runtime,
    without saving it to the viebrc.json settings/config file.
    It is always in the form of:
    <pre class="command-block">set setting value</pre>
    For example, to increase the notification duration for the current session,
    use the following command (from 3 seconds to 5 seconds):
    <pre class="command-block">set notification.duration 5000</pre>
    If no notification is shown, the setting was succesfully applied.
    Note that the duration and position of the notifications can only be changed
    if the Vieb notification is used instead of system notifications.
    Lastly, Vieb will automatically block websites with an invalid or missing certificate.
    To bypass this, either enter the url with the full protocol (http://),
    or change the following setting:
    <pre class="command-block">set redirectToHttp true</pre>
    The setting argument is case-insensitive when using the set command,
    but the value is always case-sensitive.
    <h2 id="commands-reload">reload</h2>
    The reload command can be used to reload the settings from the settings file.
    It takes no arguments, required or optional.
    This command is implemented in Vieb according to these steps:
    <ul>
        <li>All settings are reset to the defaults hard-coded in the Vieb source.</li>
        <li>
            The user settings are merged with these default settings,
            which means only settings present in the viebrc.json are changed.
        </li>
    </ul>
    As a result of this, all previous set command changes are reset by using reload.
    This can be used to undo any wrong changes, to quickly change back,
    or to change the <a href="#settings-viebrc-keybindings">keybindings</a>.
    The viebrc file is not locked by Vieb and you are free to change it any time.
    It can be used to change the keybindings without restarting Vieb,
    or to change the settings permanently (instead of the temporary set command).
    A short version of the reload command is just using "r".
    <h2 id="commands-quit">quit</h2>
    Last but not least is the quit command.
    This simple command takes no arguments,
    and is the proper way to quit Vieb.
    For beginners who haven't changed the related keybindings,
    these are the steps to quit Vieb regardless of mode:
    <ul>
        <li>Press <kbd>Escape</kbd> to go back to normal mode.</li>
        <li>Enter <kbd>:</kbd> or "Shift with ;" to enter command mode.</li>
        <li>Type "quit" into the navbar and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.</li>
    </ul>
    The short version of the quit command is "q".
    <h1 id="special">Special pages</h1>
    Vieb has a couple of special pages that can be accessed like so "vieb://help".
    Most of these pages also have a dedicated command to navigate to them,
    but using nav mode to go there is possible as well.
    Each special page will be explained below.
    <h2 id="special-help">help page</h2>
    This is the current page and also a complete reference of Vieb's functionality.
    The location of this special page is <a href="">"vieb://help"</a>.
    You can link to specific section of this page using "vieb://help#basics",
    or by calling the <a href="#commands-help">help command</a> with extra arguments.
    <h2 id="special-downloads">downloads page</h2>
    This page displays a list of all the downloaded files for the current session.
    If/when history management is done and released,
    there will be an option to store downloads beyond the current session.
    There are three download methods in Vieb (setting: "downloads.method"):
    <ul>
        <li>
            automatic (default) - which will download all files automatically similar to chrome,
            the configured "downloads.path" will be used to store all downloads.
        </li>
        <li>
            ask - when this mode is active, the download path will not be used,
            but instead a file explorer will be displayed to ask for the download location.
        </li>
        <li>
            confirm - in this mode the :accept and :reject commands are used to confirm a download.
            On the downloads page the current unconfirmed download is shown.
            As with the automatic download setting, the "downloads.path" location is used to store the download.
        </li>
    </ul>
    All downloads regardless of mode will be displayed on the downloads page,
    which can also be accsed as "vieb://downloads" or with the <a href="#commands-downloads">downloads command</a>.
    <h2 id="special-version">version page</h2>
    This page contains the current Vieb version and a button to check for updates.
    It can be accessed with the :version command (:v), or as "vieb://version".
